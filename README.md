# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

## Introduction

Hello! My name is Chris Smith and I am a former customer service leader, language tutor, and university instructor with a growing excitement for working with data. After getting my Master's Degree in English Literature from the prestigious Sorbonne in Paris, France, I spent 5 years teaching Writing and Research courses at the University of Florida and University of Tampa. As such, I have exceptionally strong skills in communication and adapting information for diverse audiences. 

During the pandemic, I worked in customer service and became a customer service leader, further cementing my communication and teamwork capabilities. However, I knew I wanted to work in a more technical field that challenged me on a daily basis. In 2024, I completed a Bachelor's in Software Engineering. This portfolio is the result of my desire to use the data analysis skills I developed and continue to nurture, as well as parley into a new career.

## Insurance Claims Complaints in Connecticut

The goal of this project was to examine insurance claim complaints lodge against insurance companies in the state of Connecticut. I wanted to see if there was a clear relationship between factors such as the reason or processing time and the recovery amount for the complaints.
